**NameSorter** 
--

A dotnet core (2.1) console application written in C# that accepts a path to a .txt file as an argument.
The argument file should contain a list of unsorted names.
Theses names will then be sorted alphabetically in order of the lastnames. 
The results are printed to the console and written to a sorted-names-list.txt in applications working directory.
